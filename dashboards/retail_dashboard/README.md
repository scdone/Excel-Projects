# RETAIL DASHBOARD

I made this dashboard in Excel with mock sales data from 'Entertainment Superstore.' 

The dashboard provides insight on KPI's including total revenue, month-over-month and year-over-year comparisons, revenue trends, comparative store revenue, products driving growth, and products driving losses.
